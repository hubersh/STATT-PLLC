			<h2>STATT PLLC</h2>
			<h4>Robert Hubers MD, MBA</h4>
			<h4>Phone: 616-915-8404</h4>
			<p>
				STATT PLLC is an independent group of Board-Certified Emergency Medicine
				Providers providing flexible interim contract staffing for ED management
				companies, hospitals and health systems.  They all currently work in traditional
				group practices and must meet our high standards for patient care and quality.
				They are easy to credential and are in the top percentiles in patient satisfaction.
				They are known ED providers that you will want to keep on staff.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our physicians reside in Western Michigan and therefore are well positioned to
				keep travel costs low for locations within Michigan. We are able to provide both
				long term, short term and emergent ED coverage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our physicians will help supplement your ED staffing needs therefore reducing
				stress and burnout of your staff, allow you to hire the correct physician as time
				permits, and relieves emergent staffing stress.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of our physicians are award winning leaders with extensive leadership
				skills running ED groups, enhancing process improvement/throughput, improved
				cost mitigation and revenue generating skills. These skills can be contracted on
				an as needed basis.
